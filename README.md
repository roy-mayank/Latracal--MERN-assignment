## Repo Description

This repository hosts code for a MERN stack Book Review Management system. It was part of an assignment from 'Latracal Solutions'. Unfortunately, I had to abandon some functionalities due to the deadline like the user model in database, profile management page, auth and featured books home page

FrontEnd Stacks: React, vite, TailwindCSS, Ant Design, React-router
BackEnd Stacks: MongoDB, node.js
API: express.js

#### How to Operate

To run:
1. Open frontend, backend directories and run npm install to retrieve all the pnpm node modules.
2. then add '.env. file to backend directory that holds Mongo URI
3. Run 'node seed.js' once in terminal at backend directory
4. Then run 'node index.js' to run API
5. use 'pnpm run dev' or 'pnpm build' to run the frontend of the application
6. Assess the application
